# ArtGAN

Authored by Kenan Karavoussanos.

For a detailed review of this project, read the report.

ArtGAN runs in Google Colaboratory with GPU run time.
Dataset is 5632, 128 x 128 RGB, images of Impressionist, Pointillist, Fauvist and Expressionist artworks.
Dataset is stored in the form of pickle files. These files are too big for Github (27MB when compressed).
Send pull request or message me on LinkedIn/Instagram to access dataset.

If you would like to use your own images, use 128 x 128 RGB Images stored in a python list and then pickled. Each pickle file should contain the same number of images. 

The prepareDataset Notebook contains some image preparation code as well as a Reddit API wrapper to retrieve i.redd.it images from posts on a subreddit.
