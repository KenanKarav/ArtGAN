% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) have seen a significant amount of research since the release of the seminal paper by \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. The basic idea of a GAN is to pit two neural networks against one another in what is known as a minimax game. The \emph{Generator} takes in random input $\boldsymbol{z}$ and constructs an output  $G(\boldsymbol{z})$. This is fed into the \emph{Discriminator} which tries to determine whether the input is real or fake. The game is played by the Generator continually trying to fool the Discriminator into thinking all its outputs are real, while the Discriminator continually tries to learn to discriminate between $G(z)$ and $x \in$ the dataset. 

GANs have been used extensively to generate realistic images including faces \cite{gauthier2014conditional} and artwork \cite{tan2017artgan}. The focus of this paper is to use a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN) to generate artworks from four similar styles of the late 19th century. Specifically, impressionism, pointillism, fauvism and expressionism, see Fig. 1. 



\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Collection}

The images were collected using google image search and a bulk images downloader. Specifically, we searched the site www.wikiart.org for the style keyword e.g impressionism, pointillism etc. Once all the images were downloaded, a small script was run to remove all images that were not of the JPEG file type. The JPEG file type is preferable to PNG because JPEG has 3 colour channels as opposed to 4 in PNG. This means the dimensionality of our datapoints is reduced meaning less data is required.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
\includegraphics{StyleOriginal.jpg}
\caption{Image samples by style: From top left;  Impressionism, Pointillism, Expressionism and Fauvism.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Preprocessing}
All the JPEG images were resized to 128 x 128 pixels using the PIL image library with Antialiasing to downscale the image. If the image was not square, it was then padded to fit the 128 x 128 size. These images were then transposed to double the size of our dataset. After this process, the image pixel values were scaled to the range [-1,1] so the Generator can make use of the tanh activation function at its output. This has been shown to improve color saturation of generated images \cite{radford2015unsupervised}. Once scaled, the images were flattened, this improves performance of the next step, which is object serialization. The python pickle package was used to serialize an array of 512 images. In total we have 11 of such batches, thus our data set size is 5632 images.



\section{Objective Function}

The network can be described as a two-player zero sum minimax game and is expressed by the following objective function:
\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{equation}
    
    \resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{$\min_{G}\max_{D} V(D,G) =  \mathbf{E}_{\boldsymbol{x}\sim{p_{dataset}(\boldsymbol{x})}}[log D(\boldsymbol{x})] + \mathbf{E}_{\boldsymbol{z}\sim{p_{\boldsymbol{z}}(\boldsymbol{z})}}[log(1-D(G(\boldsymbol{z})))]$}
    
\end{equation}

\end{figure}



Where, $\boldsymbol{x}$ is an image from our dataset, $\boldsymbol{z}$ is a random variable distributed as $p_{\boldsymbol{z}}(\boldsymbol{z})$. $G(\boldsymbol{z})$ is a fake image. $V$ the value function is some loss function that the Generator seeks to minimize and the Discriminator seeks to maximize. The optimal point for this minimax game is known as \emph{Nash Equilibrium}, this is a state where any change in the strategy of either player will not produce an advantage given that the other player's strategy remains the same. We will see in the next section why reaching this equilibrium point is desirable for our GAN.


\section{Training a Generative Adversarial Network}

In this section we provide the main training algorithm of the Generative Adversarial Network as well as describe the potential issues one may face while training a GAN.

\subsection{Training Algorithm}

  }
  $Count \gets Count + 1$
 }
 \caption{GAN Training}
\end{algorithm}
    \subsection{Common GAN training issues.}
    
\subsubsection{Modal Collapse}
The distribution of the dataset may consist of multiple modes. In a situation where the generator sees success when generating data similar to these modes, unless the discriminator can find a strategy where it can distinguish the generator output and data from this mode, the generator will stick to the strategy of generating data similar to the mode. This situation is referred to as Modal Collapse. This is can be seen when the generator loss decreases drastically and the discriminator loss increases drastically. Modal collapse is a common occurrence during GAN training and the two prevention strategies used in this work are: \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Penalizing overconfidence in the Generator.
    \item Adding randomness ,e.g noise or dropout, to the discriminator network. 
    
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{ModalCollapse.png}
    \caption{Modal collapse. Top row: 5 samples generated from 5 random seeds. Bottom row: 5 samples generated using the same random seeds. }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}\\
Figure 2 shows an example of modal collapse. The top row were images generated from 5 random seeds. The bottom row shows images generated using the same 5 random seeds, 10 epochs later. Notice the variation in the top row and the lack thereof in the bottom row.  \\


A special case of Modal Collapse is when an initial modal collapse occurs, the discriminator learns a strategy to discriminate these outputs, then the generator will collapse onto another mode. This repeats and the generator oscillates from mode to mode and the discriminator cannot find a strategy to stop this oscillation.\\

\subsubsection{Non-convergence}

The GAN objective function is non-convex, as such gradient descent based optimizers are not guaranteed to find a global minimum i.e the Nash Equilibrium. It has been shown that gradient descent optimizers can enter a stable orbit rather than converging to a minimum\cite{salimans2016improved}. The results from the fact that a change in strategy from one player will result in a change of strategy from another player. If these changes in strategy become cyclical, the gradient descent algorithm will enter said stable orbit. This can be seen as periodicity in the loss function during training.\\

\subsubsection{Diminishing Gradients}

If the discriminator begins to overpower the generator i.e it cannot find a successful strategy, the generator gets "backed up into a corner". Formally, any change to the generator's weights will result in an increased cost, this is analogous to being stuck in a local minimum. As such the rate at which the generator learns is reduced. This can be visualised as the generator loss being squeezed to a higher value while the discriminator loss approaches zero. This can be avoided by using an optimizer that can escape or avoid local minima. \\

\section{Implementation Details}

This section describes the specific implementation of the GAN used in this work. The software and hardware used as well the architectures used are described.

\subsection{Software and Hardware}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tensorflow 2.0.0-alpha0.
    \item Google Colaboratory.
    \item The ADAM Optimizer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nvidia Tesla 24GB K80 
    \item 16GB RAM 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture}

This section provides a description and motivation of the architectures of the Generator and Discriminator Networks. For full Tensorflow architecture diagrams, refer to the appendix at the end of this document.

\subsubsection{Generator}
The Generator consists of a Fully connected layer followed by four Transpose Convolutional layers. The Transpose Convolutional layers upsample the input noise and produce and image of the required dimensions.
All hidden layers use ReLU activations and the output layer uses the Tanh activation function. These activations were chose as it has been shown that these activation functions for the generator stabilize training \cite{radford2015unsupervised}. All hidden layers are batch normalized. 

\subsubsection{Discriminator}

The Discriminator consists of 4 convolutional layers, 2 with dropout and 2 without, and a fully connected layer at the output. This network uses strided convolution to downsample the image as opposed to pooling layers. LeakyReLU activations are used for all hidden layers as they have been shown to improve GAN performance when used in the Discriminator \cite{radford2015unsupervised}. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function. All hidden layers are batch normalized.

\section{Results}

The network was trained over 200 epochs, with an average epoch taking approximately 130 seconds, yet failed to converge. From figure 3 we can see that the loss discriminator network quickly approaches zero. The large spikes in discriminator loss are indicative of modal collapse, however the discriminator recovers from these spikes. This is indicative of the generator oscillating between modes. The loss is roughly periodic, this is evidence that the ADAM optimizer, which is a gradient descent based optimizer, has entered a stable orbit as described by \citet{salimans2016improved}. \\

Despite this, from figure 4 we can see the Generator is learning. At epoch 1, the generated images are relatively homogeneous. At epoch 100, we can see distinct blobs and foreground and background with high colour contrast. At epoch 200, we can see the colour palette becomes more refined and there blobs become less jagged. This shows that given enough training time, this network may prove to converge.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}

This goal of this work was to generate 19th century artwork with the use of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. We describe the collection and preprocessing steps of a set of similarly styled 19th century artworks. We discuss the theory and i behind GANs as well as the GAN training algorithm. We examine common issues with training a GAN and provide strategies to overcoming said issues. The Deep convolutional architectures of the Generator and Discriminator networks are discussed and justified. The GAN was trained for 200 epochs yet failed to converge and this failure was linked back to the common GAN training issues discussed earlier in the work. Despite this, we can see the evolution of the Generator through samples of images produced throughout training and this hints at the potential convergence of the network given enough training time.
